  "milestone": "ui-fixes",
  "reviewer": "scrutiny-validator",
  "status": "pass",
  "summary": "The chat auto-scroll fix correctly generalizes the previous exitSpec-only scroll logic to also handle the Generating indicator. It respects the isAtBottomRef to avoid scrolling when user has scrolled up manually.",
  "codeQuality": {
    "score": "good",
    "notes": [
      "Unified scroll logic for both Generating indicator and SpecReviewCard footer content",
      "Properly checks isAtBottomRef.current before scrolling - preserves manual scroll position",
      "Uses computed booleans (showsGenerating, showsExitSpec, hasFooterContent) for clarity",
      "Two-phase scroll approach (scrollToIndex then scrollBy after 150ms delay) handles footer render timing",
      "Cleanup function properly clears timeout to prevent memory leaks"
    ]
  },
